REFACTORING:

USER STORY:
AS a marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

GETTING STARTED:
1-Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.
2-When you're ready to deploy, use the [git add], [git commit], and [git push] commands to save and push your code to your 
  GitHub Repository.
3-Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select Settings tab on the right side of the page.
4-On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.  Then, in the section labeled Source, select the 
  [main] brance as your source.
5-Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live!
  For example, if your GitHJub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", 
  then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
